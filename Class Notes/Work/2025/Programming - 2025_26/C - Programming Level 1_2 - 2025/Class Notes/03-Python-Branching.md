# Branching

23 September

## `if`

Branching is a concept in computer science that allows us to write code that has *two or more different outcomes*.

This is the "grammar" of the `if` expression.

```python
if <statement>:
	<code block - line 1>
	<...>
	<code block - line n>
```

Example:
```python
user_name = "Mr. Ubial"
if user_name == "Mr. Ubial":
	print("Access granted.")
	print("You can see all the secret information.")
```

## `elif and else`

`elif` and `else` are keywords we can use to extend our `if` statements.

If we want to add *more* branches to our statement, we use these keywords.

`elif` is short for `else if`.

```python
user_name = "Mr. Ubial"
if user_name == "Mr. Ubial":
	print("Access granted.")
	print("You can see all the secret information.")
elif user_name == "Spongebob":
	print("🎶 Who lives in a pineapple under the sea? 🎶")
	print("🎶 Spongebob Squarepants. 🎶")
elif user_name == "Abraham Lincoln":
	print("Abe Lincoln? I heard you're a good wrestler.")
else:
	print("I don't have any secrets for you.")
```

## Booleans

> Asking my Computer Science nerd friends.
> "Do you want pizza OR burgers to eat for dinner?"
> All of them replied:
> "YES!"

**Booleans** are a type of data in Python. Booleans are binary and are either `True` or `False`.

```python
is_sunny = True

if is_sunny:
	print("You should probably wear sunscreen.")
else:
	print("Maybe you should bring a sweater?")
```


### `or`

`or` can be used to join two or more statements together.
`or` is true if and only if at least one statement is True.

```python
food_to_eat_one = "pizza"
food_to_eat_two = "burgers"

if food_to_eat_one == "pizza" or food_to_eat_two == "burgers":
	# This outcome will occur
	print("We're going to eat pizza or burgers.")
else:
	print("We're not going to eat pizza or burgers.")
```

### `and`

`and` is true if and only if **both** statements are True.

```python
x = "cats"
y = "dogs"

if x == "cats" and y == "dogs":
	print("It's raining cats AND dogs.")
else:
	print("We have either a cat or a dog or neither.")
```

```python
want_cookies = True
want_chips = True

if want_cookies and want_chips:
	print("You get both!")    # This will print
else:
	print("You get none.")
```
