# Files and Data

18 November 2025

## Files
For this section, we'll learn how to open and read text files.
When we open up files, we need to consider the location
or **path** to the file.
The **path** to the file is the direction we take to get to the file.
Included in a path, is the **file's name** and the folder that
it lives in.

### Opening Files
To open a file, we use the `open()` function. The `open()` function
returns a **file object**. A **file object** represents a **file stream**
which is like a pipe that connects our python file to the external file.
```python
# information.txt is a file that we want to open
file = open("information.txt")
```

### Reading their contents
When reading the contents of a file, you receive the first line of data,
then the second, ... , all the way to the end.
Use the `.readline()` method to read one line of information.
If you call it again, it will give you the next line of information.
```python
#  omitted code above
first_line = file.readline()		# string
second_line = file.readline()		
```

If you want to read all lines of the file, **iterate over the file**.
```python
# omitted code above
for line in file:
	# do something with the line
	print(line)         # line is a string
```

### Managing File Streams
When we open up a file stream, we should always close it after
we've finished reading/writing any info. This helps to lower the risk
of corrupting any data in the file. To close a file stream, we use the
`.close()` method.

```python
# omitted code above
file.close()				# closes the stream safely
```

An alternate way to open/close files is to use the `with` keyword. `with`
helps us create these things described as closures.
```python
# the file is information.txt
with open("information.txt") as file:
	line = file.readline()
	for line in file:
		print(line)

file.readline()					# this would break
```

## Lists
Lists are a type of data that are helpful in storing more than one
piece of information that is related. With lists, order matters. To
create a list we use `[]` called brackets.

```python
# To create an empty list
some_list = []
```

###  Converting a String to a List
There are times where we want to get information from a string.
One use case where this is applicable is the example of a `.csv`
or comma-separated values file.
```csv
Name,Age,Favourite Superhero
Mr. Ubial,67,Batman
Bruce Wayne,32,Superman
You Here,16,Plantar Fasciitis Man
```

```python
# omitted code above
info = "Mr. Ubial,67,Batman"
# split the string wherever there's a ,
info_list = info.split(",")     # ["Mr. Ubial", "67", "Batman"]
```

### Getting a Specific Item from a List
To access a specific element inside the list, we use `[]`
bracket notation. To get a certain thing from inside the list,
we need to "know" the address, which we call the **index**.
**Indices** are always integers.
```python
# omitted code above
# index     ->       0        1        2 
# info_list -> ["Mr. Ubial", "67", "Batman"]
# how do we access age?   ---> use index 1
print(f"Mr. Ubial's age is {info_list[1]}.")
# how do we access fave superhero? ----> -1
print(f"Mr. Ubs' fave hero is {info_list[-1]}.")
```
